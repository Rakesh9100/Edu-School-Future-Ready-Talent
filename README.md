# Edu-School-Future-Ready-Talent

This is my project created for Future Ready Talent Internship.
- This is an education website named Edu School made using the tech stacks HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Future Ready Talent Internship.
- It helps the students to find the best high on demand courses for them.
- I made three pages namely Home, Courses, and Contact and added a button to change the theme from light to dark and dark to light, which makes the website more professional and beautiful.
- Students can avail the best scholarships on the courses. They can interact with the expert teachers and solve the doubts. The call support is there to get any details a student wants and get enrolled in these courses.
- This project helps both the parents and the students to view the courses and get the support assistance in their homes itself.
- The courses page is well-designed to attract the students and many courses are there at very less prices so that every student and every child can get the knowledge.
